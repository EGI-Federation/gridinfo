The Freedom of Choice for Resources mechanism (FCR) is used within a top level BDII 
to enable the Virtual Organization (VO) to influence their usage of specific services. 
The FCR portal generates a list of services available to a VO. The portal can be used 
by the VO manager to either white list or black list sites. This information is then 
downloaded by the top level BDII and it deletes the ACL for the VO on that specific 
service from the database. This results in the service not being matched in a query 
from that VO.

The generate-fcr-exclude-file script is a cron job that runs every hour. It contacts
the SAM server where the backlisted information is published. It then generates the
/var/cache/fcr/exclude.ldif file containing the information of the blacklisted resources.
This file is used by the glite-info-plugin-fcr called by the top level BDII to delete
the ACL for the VO in the listed services.

Note that this plugin is only used with the CMS VO.
