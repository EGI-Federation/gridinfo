Notes:
-------------------------------------------------
(1) Sites that are Certified, in Production and that have been monitored
   by SAM during the last week under OPS credentials.
   SAM is available at: https://lcg-sam.cern.ch:8443/sam/sam.py
   To see this page one needs a grid certificate loaded in the browser.
   The calculation of the Site availability (Status) is described at:
   https://cern.ch/twiki/pub/LCG/GridView/Gridview_Service_Availability_Computation.pdf

(2) Software version is coming from the 'CE-sft-softver' CE test. Sites
   not supporting SAM 'CE' service, or not having sent results for this
   particular test during the last week, are not counted.

(3) Job statistics taken from EGEE Accounting Portal:
    http://www3.egee.cesga.es/

(4) Extracted from GStat 2.0. It can be checked by counting the number of
    distinct hostnames from CEs with GlueCEImplementationName=CREAM.

(5) Extracted from GStat 2.0. It can be checked by counting the number of
    distinct hostnames from CEs with GlueCEImplementationName=LCG-CE.

(6) Extracted from GStat 2.0. It can be checked by counting the sites that
    have clusters which have CEs with GlueCEImplementationName=CREAM.

(7) Extracted from GStat 2.0. It can be checked by counting the sites that
    have clusters which have CEs with GlueCEImplementationName=LCG-CE.

(8) Extracted from GStat 2.0. It can be checked by counting the sites that
    have clusters which have sub clusters with
    GlueHostApplicationSoftwareRunTimeEnvironment=MPI-START

(9) Extracted from GStat 2.0. It can be checked by aggregating the logicalcpus
    of sub clusters with GlueHostApplicationSoftwareRunTimeEnvironment=MPI-START

(10) Extracted from GStat 2.0. We consider the following operating systems: AIX,
    Debian, Ubuntu and SUSE LINUX. We also consider the following RHEL Compat.
    systems: Scientific Linux, Scientific Linux CERN, ScientificCERNSLC, CentOS,
    ScientificSL, ScientificFermiLTS, RedHatEnterpriseAS, RedHatEnterpriseWS
    and ScientificSLF. If you need to publish your OS, follow:
